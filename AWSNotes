A region is a geographical area. It consists of 2 or more Availability zones
Edge Locations are endpoints for AWS for caching Content.Typically this consists of cloudfront,Amazons Content Delivery Network.
There are more EdgeLocations than regions.

IAM

Users:-End users such as employee in organisation
Group:- Collection of users, will inherit all permision of a group
Policies:- made up of document a spolicy document defines permissions what a user/group/role is able to document
Role:- Assigned to set of specific AWS resources which is then applied to a user or a group.

S3-Simple Storage Service- simple,scalabale,secured & durable for storing files(Object based storage)
Files can be stored upto 5 TB
Are stored in Buckets
Stores as Key & value with version ID,metadata  & subresources(ACL)
S3 Standard:- 99.99% available,99.99% durable,stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities & is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurently
S3 IA-For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed.Charged lesser than S3
S3 One Zone Access-IA- Same as IA but available in onle one zone.Lower cost.
S3 Intelligent Tiering-Designed to reduce cost by intelligently moving data to most cost-effective access tier without performance impact or operational overhead
S3 Glacier- For data archiving,retrival times configurable from minutes to hours.
S3 Glacier Deep archive, retrival times configurable of 12 hours acceptable.

Dynamo DB:-
No SQL, stored in SSD
Spread across 3 geographically distinct data centers 
Eventually consistent reads-best read performance
Strong consistent reads


AWS CloudFormation 
It is a service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Services resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources 
and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS. 
You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), 
and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. 
You don't need to individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what;
AWS CloudFormation handles all of that. The following scenarios demonstrate how AWS CloudFormation can help.

            }

        ]
      }
    }
  }

S3
Amazon S3 Standard, S3 Standard-IA, and S3 Glacier storage classes redundantly store your objects on multiple devices 
across a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZs) in an Amazon S3 Region before returning SUCCESS. 
The S3 One Zone-IA storage class stores data redundantly across multiple devices within a single AZ.
 These services are designed to sustain concurrent device failures by quickly detecting and repairing any lost redundancy,
 and they also regularly verify the integrity of your data using checksums.
