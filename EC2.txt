EC2--
Reserved  - Lower hourly rate
	Standard  - U can power on your instance
	Scheduled - Durable within that timeframe
	
	Can switch availability zones in same region.
	Same the instance size in instance type only for Linux.
	
Spot - Instances assigned at lower rate based on bidding
Dedicated
	Host- 
	Instance-

OnDemand -  Low cost and flexibility with no up front cost
           Ideal for auto scaling groups and unpredictable loads
		   
Reserved:-
           Steady state and predictable usage
		   Application that need reserved capacity.
		   Upfront payment reduce hourly rate
Spot     :- 
           Flexible start and end times
		   Grid Computing and HPC
		   Very low hourly compute cost
Dedicated:-
           Predictable performance
		   Complete Isolation
		   Most Expensive

Placement Group:-
         Logically grouped instances in a single availability zone.
		 Existing instances cannot be moved into a placement grouped
		 Only instance types with enhanced nw support placement group like m4,c3,etc
		 They cannot be merged.
		 Can span peered VPCs but u will not get full-bisection bandwidth between instances.
		 Reserved instances are supported at instance level but you cannot explicitly reserve capacity for a placement group.
